The Maven for Eclipse plugin requires the src/test/java directory to exist.
This sub-project does not have its own tests, this folder would normally
be empty. Since empty directories cannot be committed to git repositories, we
need this placeholder file to make sure all users have this folder when
importing the project in Eclipse.

Note that the placeholder files in enabler, examples and openxc all have unique
names (e.g. README.enabler) because if they were the same, they would cause
conflicts when being built into an Android .apk by Eclipse.
